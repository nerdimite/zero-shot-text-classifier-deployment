# Deploying a Zero Shot Classifier on CellStrat Hub

This repository contains the End-to-End source code for deploying a Zero-Shot Text Classifier as a REST API using [CellStrat Hub](https://cellstrathub.com) and integrating the API into a React App.

Zero-Shot Text Classification is based on the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task in NLP where a pair of sentences (premise and hypothesis) need to be classified as a `contradiction`, `entailment` or just `neutral`. The entailment prediction from a model trained for NLI can be used to check if two pairs of sentences are talking about the same topic.
